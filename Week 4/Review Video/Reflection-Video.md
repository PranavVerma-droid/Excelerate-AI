Intro

Hello, everyone.

Today, I want to reflect on my internship experience and share what I have learned.


key Learnings

During this internship, I have gained valuable skills in:
- **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
- **Predictive modeling**: Developing models using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- **Creating actionable insights**: Translating data findings into practical recommendations.

Challenges and Solutions

One of the challenges I faced was **dealing with imbalanced data**. I addressed this by applying **SMOTE** to balance the class distribution. Another challenge was **interpreting the results of the predictive models**. I overcame this by focusing on **feature importance analysis** and evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Future Goals

Looking ahead, I plan to continue developing my skills in **data science and machine learning**. I am particularly interested in exploring more advanced techniques for handling imbalanced data and improving model performance. I also aim to apply these skills to real-world problems and make a positive impact.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this internship has been a valuable learning experience for me. I have gained practical skills and knowledge that will be beneficial for my future career. I am grateful for this opportunity and look forward to applying what I have learned.

Thank you for watching.
